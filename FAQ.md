# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

As questions regarding the research and methodology come, they will be answered in this document.

- **Q: I want to train a Neural Network. Can I use FAI for that?**
- 
  A: Although we are not addressing any kind of learning process in this repository, we believe that FAI
  could be use to boost the performance of RL Agents. There are suggestions on how to use FMC and
  Swarm Wave to improve RL agents in the [Introduction to FAI](https://github.com/FragileTheory/FractalAI/blob/master/introduction_to_fai.md#4-combining-fai-and-rl) document.
